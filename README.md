### GIS_Projects

- Project 1: Basic GIS data for the Talgar region of southern Kazakhstan, including a pansharpened 15m resolution LandSat ETM (2017), a 30m resolution SRTM DEM, a derived layer of streams, world coutnry outlines, world cities, and the boundaries of some survey areas (in which to digitize soome featuers). This dataset also includes a QGIS project file. Instructions for the project are included, and the main aim is vector digtizing and cartography.
- Project 2: A GRASS GIS dataset for the Wadi al-Hasa in south-central Jordan. The dataset includes a GRASS location and PERMANENT mapset in the WGS84 UTM projection system. Included data are a DEM derived from 30m SRTM data, a point vector file of sites from the Wadi Hasa Survey, and a points vector file of sites from the Wadi Hasa North Bank survey. Instructions for the project are included, and the main aim is terrain analysis, least cost analysis, basic statistical analysis, and 3D rendering in GRASS. These data were used in my paper ["Integrating older survey data into modern research paradigms," published in Advances in Archaeological Practice](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isaac_Ullah/publication/284705699_Integrating_Older_Survey_Data_into_Modern_Research_Paradigms_Identifying_and_Correcting_Spatial_Error_in_Legacy_Datasets/links/574dd8c208ae061b33038523.pdf).
- Project 3: This project uses the same data as for Project 2, above. Instructions for the project are included, and the main aim is predicrtive modeling, including visibility analysis.
- Project 4; TBA. 

### R

- This contains a set of data about human mobility, subsistance, population, and environmental productivity derived from the [Standard Cross Cultural Sample](http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/sccs.html). Missing cases have been filled in via Multiple Imputation. It also contains a suite of R scripts for processing these data. Included routines are cluster analyses, Multidimentional Scaling, and Canonical Correspondence analysis. Plotting commands are also included. These data and analyses were used in my article ["Towards a theory of punctuated subsistence change," published in PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9579).

### SciPy

- A growing collection of SciPy scripts for data analysis. Stay tuned!
