Vars. 23- 60 infancy & early childhood Variables 23-32 deal with infancy only, from the first year until the transition to early childhood (see 38-39, 42, 44), usually at 12-18 months.The early and late infancy periods of variables 24-27 refer to the first few months after birth versus the period after crawling begins,usually around 9 months. Variables 33-38 include both infancy and early childhood, the latter usually to the age of 4-5 years. Variables 39-50 deal with the transition to childhood, around 12-18 months.Variables 51-60 provide a comparison of infancy and childhood.

Only the odd numbered societies are coded in this study. Some of the even numbered societies, however, have been coded by undergraduates at U.C. Irvine. Many of these even-numbered societal codes are less reliable than the original codes, and it is advised that a sample of odd-numbered cases be selected for hypothesis testing.

Encouragement of sexual behavior, taking into account its frequency, emotional intensity, importance, and variety (including range of partners) in adolescence. Heterosexual intercourse is the principal criterion, but heterosexual foreplay, masturbation, homosexuality, sexual jokes, and exposing the genitals were also considered.

The absence of sexual restraints such as taboos or restrictions on heterosexual intercourse and other erotic behavior, including heterosexual play, masturbation, and homosexuality. A high degree of modesty, such as the requirement to keep the genitals constantly covered in public, indicates moderate restraint. Incest taboos, if highly emphasized or widely extended, are considered as indicators of restraint. Note: Sexual nonrestraint = Sexual expression + 1 more or less. The authors indicate the advisability of using the sum of the two scores as a Sexual Freedom index.

Armed combat, which is fighting with weapons, is performed by military organizations. When political communities within the same cultural unit engage in warfare, this is considered to be internal war. p. 143: If there is more than one military organization within a political community, and these ... engage in armed combat, this is considered feuding or civil war, depending on the scope of the conflict. }

Otterbein (1970) also had difficulty coding this attribute because of such an assumption. Therefore, I do not consider my quantitative results on defense to be reliable. Otterbein made one useful distinction that I could not implement satisfactorily. He coded the military expectations in order of importance -- first, second, third. There were too many cases where I could not make such a judgment, even if the data on expectations per se were good. Wheeler l974:270. }

Definitions: Patterson defines slaveholding as permanent dominant violation of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons. This excludes non-hereditary slavery, and thus does not include what Murdock (1967: 166) classifies as incipient slavery. His focus is on slaveholding societies, and excludes societies largely composed of former slaves.

Gossip Factor Scales (See Divale and Seda paper with Gossip Codes for rationale). Factor analysis of Gossip variables produced eight factors with gossip variables that had loadings of .50 or higher.

Thus 1805.1 is a News & General Gossip Scale, which is the sum of the following gossip topics: Gossip about Men, Neighbors, Socializing and News, and Women).

5           3           secondary contact with the body or bones of the deceased is accorded only to individuals who are members of the society, but are not resident with their group of orientation at the time of death (e.g., an adult member has married and resides with his/her spouse at some distance from the group of orientation; or death occurs while the individual is on a trip away from the group of orientation). The body must be returned to the group of orientation for proper burial. Incidental to the returning process, the body decomposes and secondary disposal results.

3           4           secondary contact with the body or bones is practiced, with circumstances of death (e.g., struck by lightening, time of year) being the only determinant of whether or not it is accorded to an individual.

13          5           secondary contact with the body or bones is the preferred means of disposal for a proportion of the population, with status, age-grade, kin, or sodality associations determining if it is accorded to an individual.

The body must be returned to the group of orientation for proper burial. Incidental to the returning process, the body decomposes and the result is a mass of disarticulated bones, which must be disposed of.

1           4           disarticulation of human osseous remains occurs prior to final disposal only in situations where circumstances of death dictate that the body be curated until a time that is propitious for final disposal.

17          5           disarticulation of human osseous remains occurs prior to final disposal in a proportion of instances, with status, age-grade, kin, or sodality associations being the determining factor.
